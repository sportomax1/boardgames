<title>&#039;22 Dice Tower West Virtual Flea Market</title>
<description>[b][center]DTW kicks off March 2nd, but why wait to spend money until then? On the flip side, maybe you&apos;ll sell a few items ahead of time so you can buy more stuff when you get there![/b]
[IMG]https://static.wixstatic.com/media/41d157_53fc1511dcec4a6b98175ae3a6eb0e37~mv2_d_1372_1474_s_2.gif[/IMG][/center]

[b]What&apos;s this list for?[/b]

If you have items you&apos;d like to sell at Dice Tower West, you can list them here. This is not part of the actual flea market that is happening at the con. This is just a forum to work out deals in advance of the con, so you can pack/plan accordingly.

[b]***Scheduled meet-up Friday 10 AM, in Area 3/4, next to the exhibitors in the main hall.***[/b]

Not everyone will be able to make this. It&apos;s recommended that you exchange contact info and touch base with your trade partner(s) before the con.

********************************************************************************

Guidelines

When you list your item, include the condition of the game and the price you&apos;d like to sell it for. It&apos;s up to you to decide how you want the item to be sold (e.g. Fixed price, auction, best offer, etc). The transaction will be handled by you from beginning to end. Don&apos;t get offended by offers, this is a format where haggling is accepted, if not expected.

Please be aware, not everyone attends the entire convention. If this is you, it&apos;s helpful to list when you will/won&apos;t be there to avoid missing your buyer/seller.

Don&apos;t be a jerk! By agreeing to buy/sell a game, your partner is counting on you to keep your word. They are losing the chance to buy/sell with another person. Please only agree if you plan on honoring your word, and if life happens, send them a direct message asap. Also, there is no need to publicly questions prices. The market will dictate the value, it&apos;s not up to you to police it:cool:

Per BGG Guidelines, it is the seller&apos;s responsibility to process final sales through the BGG Marketplace.

It&apos;s best not to delete sold listings. This is your proof of the agreed price and condition. Just mark them as &quot;sold&quot; or change the photo to one that says &quot;sold&quot;.

Be careful of double listing 1 game. If you plan on listing a game both here and the math trade, make sure you don&apos;t commit it to 2 people. Remove it from the math trade as soon as you have a deal here, or hold off on listing it until after the trade.

********************************************************************************

Most transactions will be handled at the con (ie: exchange cash for the game). You are expected to process your transactions in the Marketplace to pay BGG their 3% commission on all sales assisted by this site. The 3% is automatically added to Geek Marketplace transactions.

There are a couple of ways you can capture the items you have sold on the list:

1. List out each transaction in the marketplace. It does take some time, but it also builds your seller credentials on the Geek. There is a quick link to do this under each of your listings. Then, send your buyer the link for the listing.


2. You can also create a marketplace dummy sale item something like &quot;Miscellaneous - DTW22 VFM Commission&quot; as the item type/description and price it at whatever ends up being your total for sales, then &quot;buy&quot; it yourself. This will generate a seller&apos;s invoice via geek mail for the 3% commission payable by PayPal.

********************************************************************************

Personal preference. If someone builds a meta-list for searching, it&#039;d be better to have individual listings.

[q=&quot;lyndathompson1&quot;]Newbie here... just wondering if there is a way/button to sort games by name throughout this entire list? There are SO many pages... I&#039;d love to sort by name on more than one page at a time.  Saw the post on how to just have the listing without pictures, but there are still a lot of pages there, and not sure how to sort the names.  If not, I totally understand.  Thanks![/q]
Previously other users had created a Master List for this purpose and Ben was able to add it to the original post. I wouldn&#039;t even know where to start with that and I am sure there is a lot of work to do to create one. I just consider it a nice bonus if it pops up at some point. Best bet is to try to keep pace with the list and subscribe to every new item that interests you.

Hey, Everyone! Quick question about GeekMarket Checkout for buyers... when I have made a &quot;Quick Marketplace Listing&quot; for the games I am selling, it puts it in the Geek Market.  However, then when the buyer goes to the listing to complete the purchase, the Checkout Cart gives a message:

&quot;Your cart contains Convention Preorder products that must be purchased on the Convention Preview page.

Follow this link to complete your purchase:&quot;

But there is no link to follow. So the purchase cannot be completed. Could you help me with this? Is there another setting I should be using on the listing? I am wondering if I need to change the &quot;Will deliver for pick up to the following event:&quot; setting (which then does not have a drop-down selection for the Dice Tower West) somehow?

All advice appreciated!  Thanks a Bunch! - Lynda

I&#039;m not exactly sure what you are doing but I will run through my process. First, I don&#039;t generate these sales until the week of the con or even when I make the exchange with the buyer. Reason being is something could always happen (con canceled, buyer backs out, you get sick, etc) yet you are on &quot;the hook&quot; for the 3% owed to BGG. So that is #1

#2 Just create a sale on the Geek Market. You can use the Quick button under the item or just create one on your own. The quick option populates the notes section which is helpful but you can always write out your own disclaimer. The dropdown doesn&#039;t work in the Quick listing option for whatever reason. Just click the button that you noted it will be fine.

#3 Don&#039;t expect everyone to follow through on this. I do my due diligence but don&#039;t beat yourself up if you never receive a response from the buyer. I like to give BGG their portion and not getting the trade rating is kind of a bummer but it is what it is. Just follow #2 on the thee original posting if that occurs.

Thanks so much for clarifying, Brian!  I will go with the &quot;Cash On Delivery&quot; option only then.  Yes, bummer on the no ratings, but ultimately just want folks to enjoy the games.  Looking forward to gaming with Everyone soon!  - Lynda

If you need someone local to ship your game to, to avoid baggage fees, send me a GM. As long as there&#039;s not an overwhelming amount of demand, I&#039;m happy to help out.

Haven&#039;t quite figured out the logistics, but I&#039;d like to put something together to help folks ship games home as well. I don&#039;t believe we have a vendor offering &quot;ship home&quot; services and on-site shipping services are ridiculous.

Just put it in your description of the item itself.  Could just say:

&quot;Will only accept bids in full dollar amounts&quot;

Or something of the like

There is no official end for this. People start finalizing everything as the con gets closer so they can pack Everything up and make arrangements.

Regarding the official exchange on Friday. I&#039;m finalizing the location and will post soon.

I recommend making a sign with your username. I have one that has my avatar, username, and name. Don&#039;t forget, most people know you by your username, so that&#039;s who they&#039;ll be looking for.

I&#039;m not going to go through all of my listings and ping all the subscribers numerous times.  I&#039;ll announce here that I am leaving early Monday morning, so if you want any of the games I&#039;ve listed, you&#039;ll need to geekmail me your offer (which will need to be pretty close to what I&#039;ve listed my items at).

[b]Seriously people, don&#039;t delete your items.  If they are no longer available just do a strikethrough.  A lot of us track our items by item number and if you delete your item you throw things off for everyone.  Please don&#039;t be an idiot.[/b]

I too found the renumbering caused by deletions to be annoying.  I got around this by copying the item numbers I cared about into a spreadsheet.  The numbers are a link to the ITEM.  So, any renumbering became irrelevant.

I wouldn’t call people idiots. I know it asks that items not be deleted but people may not read it all the way through or understand why that point is being made. It does make it more difficult to track which is why I just subscribe to all my listings individually. Then I can just run through them in my subscriptions. I do like the link in my spreadsheet idea though. Keeps it all in one place and even more organized. I’ll do that next year.

I used the spreadsheet approach by adding different sheets to track things I bought, sold, and traded. Here&#039;s a template: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wOi92PAKgA2qYJ3qhTJvvbtOBbt7R-OF8mVRee6Qk7A/edit?usp=sharing
Some folks might prefer to have it printed, but I kept it in the digital format since I can easily access it and update it on my phone at the convention.

Our spreadsheets are near identical. I even have my little notes section at the end. Next year I will have a link column to take me immediately to the listing and add a &quot;Watching&quot; tab as well for things I&#039;m interested in. Then I can stay out of my subscriptions entirely.

Have you checked your preferences in subscriptions? Make sure you didn&#039;t alter them before to not include replies or allow geeklists or anything like that. Otherwise if you are sure the subscribe button on the thread is clicked, you should be receiving notifications for every single post/reply. And if you do that, you wont receive any extra notifications for individual items that you ar specifically interested in following.

It can be both but more likely its in your general preferences. You can easily get to it by clicking on the arrow next to subscribe at the top of this page and then go to edit preferences. That will be for this geeklist specifically but you can then just hit preferences from there to see your general selections.

He was at the exchange today looking for you. I assume you&#039;ve sent him a GM?

Hey everyone, don&#039;t forget to give BGG their cut for facilitating this list. Under each of your posts, you can click &quot;make a quick market listing&quot; and enter your sale price. I just &quot;bought&quot; all of my listings myself and paid the 3%.

I lost the “make a quick market listing” when the website updated. Or did I accept a beta invite? I don’t know. But the quick function is gone now.

Hi Gabe. It is scheduled for 10am on Friday. No location has been posted yet but I’m sure it will be in the convention space. I sent you a message and my number. We can meet before if you would like. I’m heading out today and should be in around 2-3pm.

Hey! I know we talked at the convention. I wouldn&#039;t be able to send this in an envelope. It would have to be padded mailer so I wouldn&#039;t be covering the cost unfortunately. not sure you would want to do that. If i still have it next year you are more than likely to hit me up and i can bring it down.

Hi Jamie,

The games I&#039;m looking for have gotten pretty narrow lately:( Not currently looking for any of those but will be entering this in the Math Trade if it doesn&#039;t sell. That&#039;ll provide a chance to grab it in a cycle manner.

Very good. The ships may have a ding or 2 due to the resin they used, but outside of that, it&#039;s a perfectly playable copy.

Thanks for the offer, but I’m going to hold out for $50. For less I think I’d be better off having a ship 3d printed and selling closer to the actual value.

Still going to try and trade if I can&#039;t get the asking price.

Not sure if you&#039;re participating in the math trade, but you can also make cash offers on that platform. You might could end it with it for $30 and I could end up with a game from another user.

Do you by any chance make the rings for the landmark tokens as well?

No, I don&#039;t make those. I never used the tokens - I just put the buildings on the board next to their spots (which takes no time with my bases on, because everything is color coded).

That&#039;s a great idea, idk why I hadn&#039;t thought of that. I think I&#039;d like a full set (base game + both expansions). Would you consider throwing in a set of clips for the Red Rising card holders instead of any further discounts?

You got it! Now, because business is all about the upsell, could I interest you in some score markers for an additional $3? They are completely unnecessary for enjoyment of the game!

Thanks for the offer, but I actually kind of like the consistency of the cubes on the tracks &amp; scoring. So I think I&#039;ll stick with the bases &amp; clips.

Picked this up and played a friend&apos;s version to learn.  Haven&apos;t touched it since.  Amazing shape, only missing the shrink on the box.

Box top looks like the one pictured but is slightly different.  Can&apos;t tell which printing this is if anyone can help me out.</body>

I bought this a few years ago, didn&apos;t play it much.  It&apos;s in very good shape.  I can check which teams are included.  It&apos;s only a few of them, I never expanded much (if at all) past the base set.

Played a couple of times.  However, I played the entire campaign on a friend&apos;s copy, so this can move on to a new home.

Kickstarter edition, also contains all of the expansions with the exception of upgraded figures.  I took the German components out of the boxes, and I think I still have them if you want them.

	<body>Legendary Marvel Bundle - several expansions are out of print:

Base game
Captain America 75th Anniversary
Dark City
Fantastic Four
Marvel Noir
Marvel Studios, Phase 1 *New addition*
Paint the Town Red
Revelations
Secret Wars, Volume 1
X-Men

I have everything organized in the core box and Dark City box. All cards are organized and fully alphabetized with Legendary Marvel dividers - will save you greatly on set-up and tear down. Game is in excellent condition; many cards from the expansions have never been played, just sorted.

UPDATE - Located another expansion (Marvel Studios, Phase 1) for this game and updated listing - price LOWERED. This new expansion is not organized with the rest of the game.

Is this the version that came with the Ante Up campaign or Blood Money? I’m curious if it has the compatibility with the playmat which has a horseshoe for the General Store.

Good question. This is from the Ante Up campaign. I&#039;m not sure what you mean by the horseshoe.

The playmat came with a horseshoe symbol on it for both general stores, and kept the barrel for the trading post. The Blood Money version of the wooden  general store has the front piece double sided with a barrel on one side, and a horseshoe on the other. So you could flip it depending on if you were playing with the boards or the playmat.

Usually anything geek-adjacent is fine. I&#039;ve seen Video Games, Comics, PC parts, etc. Just try to stay reasonably close to the spirit of the list.

And when it comes to making sure BGG gets their cut you can use [thing=23953][/thing] to sell almost anything.

	<body>[-]Game is in new condition never played.  Took the shrink wrap off not knowing it was an expansion and I recently backed the all in on kickstarter so no longer have a need for this expansion.  I punched punch boards but cards are still in wrap and none of the components have been open so all new condition.

[q=&quot;leberwurst&quot;]Does this include the base game? If yes, than I would offer $110[/q]

Yes. This also includes the base game.  Maybe that&#039;s why I was getting some of the lower offers? I assumed if I put the base game as the listing and mentioned that it comes with the following in my post.  I can see how that might not be clear.  I&#039;ll update my listing and give it the week and see if anyone wants it at full asking and if not, I will sell to you for $110.

Oh boy, this was exactly what I was hoping someone might put up for sale! I assume everything is unopened?

Would you take $170, since that&#039;s exactly what I have on my VISA gc left? :D (If you would also accept Paypal payment that is.)

One of the best/worst parts of these is discovering which games are now OOP and valuable. I had 3 copies of this when it was a clearance title around 2015/2016. Traded one and managed $1 profit on the other 2 after sitting on them forever :shake:

Going to hold out for full asking price and/or putting this in the math trade.  If it doesn&#039;t sell or trade then I&#039;d potentially be willing to lower the price.  But for now, I&#039;ll pass, but thanks!

There&#039;s a possibility that I won&#039;t have it until DTW...I can try to get it before then but it&#039;s frankly unlikely.  If that changes things, you can certainly retract your purchase.

If you can get it for Strategicon, that would be excellent. I’ll be there. If you can’t, I have a super nice pal who is willing to mule for me from DTW. Either way, I’ll take this game. It’s been on my want to play list.

I&#039;m going to hold out for full price unless it doesn&#039;t sell for that and/or it doesn&#039;t go in the math trade.  If both of those don&#039;t happen, I&#039;d be happy to sell it for $10.

[b]Sold to Nightmaren[/b]

Rare edition only found in Korea. 
Comes with English Rule.
I am surprised how good this ladder climbing game is. Really fun and plays up to 12 players. 
Comes with +100 cards that can be used to play other games like Linko.

	<body>Only played a few times. Everything in excellent condition except for the description below:
If you have played the game you would know that the box is used as the shield between the two teams during the game. And when you flatten the box to do that, it would result in a crack on the inner fold of the box, please GM me if you&apos;re not sure what I&apos;m talking about and I&apos;m happy to show pictures. The game also came with errata stickers and those have all been applied to the correct places.

	<body>Putting a feeler out there.  FOMO on the Marvel Zombies KS.  I pledged for $1, but if I can sell this for some, then I might get some of the Marvel Zombies.  Anyways, here is what I have for this that I am willing to sell:

Adding additional info:

I did the soldier pledge.  I added the dark side box as well.  When I got the shipping email, here is everything that was listed:

1x Zombicide: Invader - Dark Side
1x Zombicide: Invader - Black Ops
1x Zombicide: Invader
1x Zombicide: Invader - Civilian Extras
1x Zombicide: Invader - Soldier Extras
1x Zombicide: Invader - Dark Side Extras

I also backed the CMON Comics which comes with the comic book and another extra pack.  The base is opened and played 3-4 times.  Cards sleeved.  The extras have also been added to base.  The Dark Side and Black Ops box are still in shrink.  All of the bad guys are in a plastic container.

Thank you for the offer.  Let me think on this one a little.  I think I have around $450 into this, so not sure what price I want to get rid of it at.

Looks like a nice heirloom set for a Scrabble enthusiast. I&#039;m not in the market for this, but I like seeing sets like this for classic games.

If it doesn&#039;t sell here, I&#039;m sure you could sell it via eBay or look for a local Scrabble club. A surprising number of them exist around the world.

Thanks - some good suggestions I just got them in the last month - not in the biggest rush to get them.  Worst case I will try to sell them again near Christmas locally they are more niche but they might gain more interest around that time.  Take care.

[q=&quot;dchorey&quot;]What does &quot;Corners have been rounded.&quot; mean?  Did you trim the cards?  Why?[/q] Part of the instructions are when you first set up the game is to take the four corner cards and cut them so that one corner is rounded. The first image shows the four corner cards as no longer being squares.

$10.  If I win, my friend Ken Aguasa will pick up on my behalf, since I am unable to attend in person.  I will pay ahead, though, if PayPal or Venmo is an option.

Thanks.  I will be in Las Vegas after all but not attending the convention (but still staying at the Rio with Ken).  So either of us can pickup.  Ken will be there tomorrow (Wed., 3/2) and I will be there either Thursday or Friday.

In either case, if you give me your PayPal or Venmo information either here or via Geekmail, I can pay you ahead.

Truthfully, it’s swing-y, random, and disjointed.  It really takes the right group of people.  Half my sessions of it have been good, half were terrible.

It’s a divisive game for sure but I am open to having it in my collection.

I&#039;ll probably hold at $40, but no worries either way.  Medici dice and Jurassic Parts are super low priority for me and I am flying so luggage space is limited :)

If you want to let them sit here for a little  and get back to me, that works as well.

Would you do $80? 

I assume the expansion does not have the box and just has been combined into main game?

The expansion box is gone. The base game was made to hold the expansion contents. I’m not going to drop the price that much on these at this point but I’ll keep it in mind. Thanks for the offer though.

That&#039;s correct it doesnt have the errata printed, but you can get the errata online as a PDF which I actually found to be easier cause you can Ctrl-F and find the section you need much faster.

I cant do more than $10 Will. Sorry! 

Its 16.50 on tabletopmerchant and 17.99 at miniature market for a new copy. So I cant pay $15 for a used copy with some box wear. If you change your mind I am still happy to take it but I cant do more than $10

This is for a game called &quot;Upstart&quot; that does not show up in the BGG database.  It is not an unpublished prototype but the first edition of the game, published in the Philippines. I am going to attempt to link to it here, but if it doesn&apos;t work, just Google &quot;Upstart the board game.&quot;  This is signed by the designer.  It is basically brand new.

Unplayed. However, some of the cards (only 3-4) got slightly stuck together during the manufacturing/shipping process, so one corner of each of those cards is messed up. Also missing one of the orange creeples, which was left out by the manufacturer. PM me if you want more info.

Yeah.... not a recharged copy.

$35 is as low as anything on BGG marketplace or anything online, which makes this a great price for a basically new game. 

If I don&#039;t get another offer, though, I&#039;d let you have it. Hopefully that works!

	<body>Hi-Oooooh!
Bye bye Covid. Hello Board gaming! Real Board games! No more of those failed Zoom play by internets, sims, apps or smoke signals. We’re coming back, BABY!!!

So, you better get ready and beef up your collection. I’ve got a plethora of games for sale and they gotta go!!!
I’m selling at very reasonable prices and I’m open to negotiating, but please just make your offers genuine and (again) reasonable! Key word: [b]Reasonable[/b], just in case you missed it, otherwise you’re gonna get the old W.C. Fields “Scram kid. You bother me.”

I’m open to very VERY few and very specific trades, but really I just need to sell these games! I’m also willing to give you a discount on buying bundles and repeat customers. 

All of these are from a smoke free, nerd hovel and have been loved and babied all their lives. Many are sleeved and some even have inserts. Many of these have also only been played once or not at all!

Not everything on the list is pictured, because I have kept adding to the list and I’m incredibly lazy, but I assure you, if it’s on the list, it’s still available!

Please PM me for any inquiries, but I suggest you go on BGG if you have any questions that are game specific. 

These are auction/not so firm a price/highest bid/Just shut up give me the money! No real rules. AKA a real no holds barred event! So, step right up and make me an offer and keep in mind that it ain’t over till the fat lazy bastard (aka me) loads up the car on Tuesday night before the con at 6PM sharp. 

Speaking of loading the car, as I mentioned, I’m incredibly lazy. So, if you’re in LA and [b]you want to pick some of these up in Torrance[/b] I can give you a small discount depending on what game(s) you want to buy.

There has to be something you want on that list. Don’t shake your head and tell me no. That’s BS and you know it. Go back and check it again. You missed something. I know you did. You know you did. Now go back check it twice and make an offer. Go on. Don’t be a cheap skate. Make me an offer. You’d be surprised at what I’d be willing to take to get some of these games out of here. 

BTW if you think this is funny you should meet me in meat space. If you see  a handsome, well groomed, middle aged stud wandering around looking like he owns the joint, it’s probably me “The V”. So, come up and say wassup to your boy and let’s play a game!!
See you in Vegas, Baby!!!

List updated 02/25/22. 
Come on! There’s still plenty out there. Dig in and look hard. There’s something in there for you. I just know there is!!!
List updated again 02/26/22
You’re running out of time! Come on! Get in there and pick out a game and make is a reasonable offer! You can do it! I believe in you. 

Update 9:00AM 2/28
The car will be loaded up tomorrow morning at this time. So, make your last minute purchases cuz this is winding down for me. I’ll see you all at the con. 
V.

Sorry about that, mate. I put the wrong name down in my response. My bad. I have the Core Pledge for Siege Storm. Never played. I think some of the cards are even sealed. 
Secrets is already spoken for. 
Paper Tales is still yours for the taking as well. 
I can do both for $75

Sorry, I should say I need to be firm on these.  I paid WAY too much!  I thought it was the 2nd Edition I was purchasing.  And I think 40 is reasonable. (but I do highly recommend the 2nd Ed which you can get retail locally here for (checking)... $150  hmmm, thinking about it, $40 does sound better doesn&#039;t it?)

Ah, fair enough. Any chance I could offer you $75 to take it off your hands? A friend would really like to have this and I&#039;m hoping to give it to her as a gift.

No worries, if not. Just want to throw it out there.

Gotta give this game a quick shoutout. I recently acquired and played it. Seems like a hidden gem to me! If you like 2p &quot;dueling&quot; games give this one a look. Can&#039;t go wrong at this price point.

Hey Mark. This one looks cool too. It looks like In a Grove. I put the bid in for Temporal Odyssey above as well. Would you take $20 for both? Or would you be interested in a trade from my list?

Hi Mark, Just confirming that &quot;Sure!&quot; was for me?  Saw the counter offer on the War of the Ring bundle and just wanted to check. Cheers

Oh, sorry.  The sure was for the possibility of making trades.  As far as your offer, I&#039;m going to hold off for now, but perhaps as the flea market winds down if it doesn&#039;t sell or trade for full asking here or in the Geekmarket I&#039;d be willing to revisit in case you were still interested at the time.

I sold one copy of this to texanfan, but I have another in shrink copy that is currently without a bid, aside from Ben&#039;s offer of $30 for this and Smash Up.

Man your killing me with all the games you posted today i want 10 of them ha.  I think i have my mind wrapped around the following 5 and i was wondering if you would take 110 for them:
Alien Frontier
51st State
Scythe
Wingspan
Smashup

Let me know if that works

Not at the moment, but if it doesn&#039;t sell/get traded here or on the Geekmarket towards the end of the flea market I&#039;d likely revisit it if you were still interested at the time.

FYI, the first three of the games you have cited above are games I&#039;m mulling for a friend who is holding out for full asking so I think it&#039;s unlikely there&#039;ll be a discount involved, though I&#039;m certainly happy to ask him.

Never played but has been opened to verify contents.

EDIT****
Sorry for the confusion but I realized that I did not make it clear this  is open for auction. I had a section of my rules not copy and paste properly. 
****
EDIT:

Rules: 
Whole dollar increments only. No snipping please. If I have any offers within 4 hours of closing listing I will ping the last bidder and give them 4 hours to respond. 


I will be closing this listing on Sunday Feb. 27th at 12:00 eastern. I will be packing up after that and need to know what games I will be bringing. 

I will be at the Con all days and will be running a table in the demo area from 4pm to 10 pm. So it will be easy for us to meet up. </body>

Hi Brad. could you please elaborate on the good condition after only being played once. Are the box/components kind of beatup based off that rating? Thanks!

Components are VG condition, looks like it has not been played much. I got it second-hand - so there is tape in the sides where someone &#039;sealed&#039; it.

	<body>I&apos;m looking for about $350, but I&apos;m willing to consider serious offers.

Complete Eternal Pledge+ Kickstarter for [i]Ankh: Gods of Egypt[/i]. Also includes the playmat and art book.

Everything except for the play mat is NIS (New in shrink), and the play mat has been used twice and is in like-new condition.

I really enjoy the game, but my best friend has a complete set as well, and since he&apos;s the only one I ever play it with, I decided I don&apos;t need my own set.

Includes the following:
- Base game
- Tomb of Wonders (Kickstarter exclusive upgraded pieces)
- Pantheon expansion
- Pharaoh expansion

Got it. I&#039;m not really interested in splitting it out just yet, but if, in a few days, I haven&#039;t sold the full set, I may be willing to consider it.

Full Kickstarter Edition. Only played a few times. Good game, but not one that I&apos;ll be able to get to the table often.

Includes:
- Base game, including Kickstarter exclusive Centaur race
- [i]The Freeze[/i] expansion. Some very minor wrinkling on one corner of the box, but otherwise pristine.
- [i]A New Enemy[/i] expansion, which creates a solo or co-op horde mode.</body>

Somebody should buy this. It is my absolute favorite polyomino game. The art. The action selection.  Tile placement. Aghh! It’s so good. And it plays well at 2 players!

Have u pulled the harder cards to get and sold them separately?

I&#039;m only missing a few hard to find cards and there dice but if they may still reside in this lot I may be subject to a bid.

I think the lot is mostly commons/uncommons/some rares. These are just the duplicates that I have collected over time. I think it&#039;s a great set to start with or round out your collection but probably not for you if you are chasing a few specific harder to get cards.

If you’re ok splitting(seeing that andres wants the base) I’d be interested in the kickstarter extras. I have the base, arrrmada, build a robot, showdown and would be happy to pick everything else up. If that sounds good Let me know! If you can list what exactly you have I can place an offer/feel free to price it.

Hey Karim that sounds good. Andres would you want the base, arrrmada, build a robot, and show down since Karim already has those?
Karim the extra stuff I have is Zenith Invasion, Thorne Troopers, companion pack, scenary pack, Patty &amp; Sherry, Nayomi &amp; Tanaka, Brandalyn &amp; Jakob, Curi &amp; Yuri, Plastic Token Pack, Wound token pack, I believe I have the crew dice bundle dice for each player. Would have to check for sure though when I am back home later today. For price I thought about it and am just trying to get space for other games. Would you both want to do 130 each for the split?

Sorry @Andres I would only be able to either a/get all the kickstarter stuff or b/ none of it. It will be really hard to get some of the kickstarter stuff later (as its unlikely people will split the kickstarter extras if they have them all)

so what you would get would be:
1/ Base box
2/ Arrrmada
3/ Build a robot
4/ Showdown

I would purchase:

1/Zenith Invasion
2/Thorne Troopers
3/ Build a robot companion pack
4/scenary pack
5/Patty &amp; Sherry
6/Nayomi &amp; Tanak
7/Brandalyn &amp; Jakob
8/Curi &amp; Yuri
9/Plastic Token Pack
10/Wound token pack
11(TBC)/crew dice bundle
12(TBC)/space marauders
13(TBC)/build a robot extras
14(TBC)/needles

TBC = To be confirmed. Waiting to see if Trapper has them.

[-]THIS DOES NOT CONTAIN THE BASE GAME

This listing is for the contents included in wave 2 of the Kickstarter All-In Pledge. I sold the first wave already, but anyone that bought the game in the aftermarket and is interested in having the rest of the content, this is your chance to get it at a &quot;reasonable&quot; price without having to pay for shipping.

Everything is brand new and still in shrink. It includes the following:

[thing=259120][/thing]
[thing=259119][/thing]
[thing=259118][/thing]
[thing=259116][/thing]
[thing=259117][/thing]
+ Errata Pack Fixing Issues with content in Wave 1

	<body>Fun game with one person seeing what to build but can&apos;t talk, one person interpreting their gestures but can&apos;t touch, and the third doing the building but can&apos;t see.
Great experience. Especially good learning experience for kids.

	<body>PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS NOT FOR THE ACTUAL GAME.

This is for the replacement cards that were misprinted in the Deluxe Master Set. The latest kickstarter (the one with the UnPleasant surprise) has an extra round of cards that replace the misprinted ones. That&apos;s it (I think there&apos;s 7 in total).

Giving it out for free.

DONE. Given to [user=Flightsurg][/user]</body>

No, the UnPleasant surprise kickstarter variant comes with the correct cards. The additional fixed cards were part of the addon that came with some extra modules and were not listed separately. (this was designed as an easy way for original deluxe set owners to get the new modules and fixed cards all in one. For whoever backed the whole game ended up with an extra set of fixed cards).

Hi there!

I was backer #3190 from the Deluxe Master KS campaign, didn’t know these cards had been made available. If they haven’t yet been provided to someone else, could I get them please?

Either way, nice of you to make these available.

I will be at DTW Friday afternoon and much of Saturday and Sunday.

Thanks!

I&#039;ll buy it from you for $30.  I&#039;m here at the Rio but not attending the Con.  So if I can pick it up from you elsewhere in the hotel, I&#039;ll buy it.

If you accept my offer, we can work out the exchange on geekmail.
