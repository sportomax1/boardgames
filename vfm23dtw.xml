<title>&#039;23 Dice Tower West Virtual Flea Market</title>
<description>[center][b]DTW kicks off March 8th, but why wait to spend money until then? On the flip side, maybe you&apos;ll sell a few items ahead of time so you can buy more stuff when you get there![/b]

[IMG]https://static.wixstatic.com/media/41d157_53fc1511dcec4a6b98175ae3a6eb0e37~mv2_d_1372_1474_s_2.gif[/IMG][/center]

[b]What&apos;s this list for?[/b]

If you have items you&apos;d like to sell at Dice Tower West, you can list them here. This is not part of the physical flea market that is happening at the con. This is just a forum to work out deals in advance of the con, so you can pack/plan accordingly.

[b]***Scheduled meet-up Friday 10 AM.***[/b]

[imageid=7381866 medium]

Not everyone will be able to make this. It&apos;s recommended that you exchange contact info and touch base with your trade partner(s) before the con.

********************************************************************************

[b]Guidelines[/b]

When you list your item, include the condition of the game and the price you&apos;d like to sell it for. It&apos;s up to you to decide how you want the item to be sold (e.g. Fixed price, auction, best offer, etc). The transaction will be handled by you from beginning to end. Don&apos;t get offended by offers below your asking price. This is a format where haggling is accepted, if not expected.

Please be aware, not everyone attends the entire convention. If this is you, it&apos;s helpful to list when you will/won&apos;t be there to avoid missing your buyer/seller.

[b]Don&apos;t be a jerk![/b] By agreeing to buy/sell a game, your partner is counting on you to keep your word. They are losing the chance to buy/sell with another person. Please only agree if you plan on honoring your word. If life happens and you won&apos;t be able to complete your transaction, please send them a direct message asap. Also, there is no need to publicly questions prices. The market will dictate the value, it&apos;s not up to you to police it:cool:

It&apos;s best not to delete sold listings. This is your proof of the agreed price and condition. Just mark them as &quot;sold&quot; or change the photo to one that says &quot;sold&quot;. You can change the picture id to 6602898 &amp; it will display this :arrowS:.

[ImageID=6602898 micro]

Be careful of double listing 1 game. If you plan on listing a game here and in the math trade, make sure you don&apos;t commit it to 2 people. Remove it from the math trade as soon as you have a deal here, or hold off on listing it until after the trade.

********************************************************************************

Most transactions will be handled at the con (ie: exchange cash for the game). You are expected to process your transactions in the Marketplace to pay BGG their 3% commission on all sales assisted by this site. The 3% is automatically added to Geek Marketplace transactions.

There are a couple of ways you can capture the items you have sold on the list:

1. List each transaction in the marketplace. There is a quick link to do this under each of your listings. Then, send your buyer the link for the listing.


2. You can also create a marketplace dummy sale item something like &quot;Miscellaneous - DTW23 VFM Commission&quot; as the item type/description and price it at whatever ends up being your total for sales, then &quot;buy&quot; it yourself. This will generate a seller&apos;s invoice via geek mail for the 3% commission payable by PayPal.

3. BGG&apos;s commission is on the honor system and will not be policed by me.

IDK if this is exactly what you&#039;re looking for, but at the top of this geeklist there is a link for a document that lists everything in alphabetical order. It can make it fast to look to see if something specific is for sale.

Agreed.  I learned this last year when I was buying an obscene amount of games.

In addition to subscribing to each item, you can also grab the hyperlink of each item.  The location to do that changes on desktop and mobile.

For mobile, it’s the link that says when something was added/edited, right below the user name.

For desktop, I believe that link is towards the bottom right-hand corner of the listing.

Hope that helps.

All joking aside, I plan on running a game of [thing=104581][/thing] right after the meet-up on Friday. I&#039;ll open it up for registration when we get closer to the con. Some of the most fun you can have in a stock market game.

Those of you doing auctions... couple of tips I&#039;ve seen work in my last 7 years doing VFM...

1.  Put an end time that isn&#039;t 3 days before the con.  People don&#039;t want to wait that long and some people go off a budget and they want to know what they are buying ahead of time... (or luggage needs.)
2.  Make people bid often by having an auction that works like this, &quot;the auction will end after a bid sits uncontested for X amount of days.&quot;  It makes people bid often and early!  
3.  Start your auction off with a low dollar amount.  Each bid causes a ping and people will see the bid.  They might jump in.  If you set the starting bid a $45 with a BIN at $55, a bunch of people will keep scrolling.  

Just ideas... but please please please put the terms of your auction in the listing and state when it will end.

So I know there’s a formal wishlist, and I did post a few games I’m seeking out on that list, but figuring that many people likely do not look at that list, I figured I’d post a couple here in case anyone has either of these and they’re willing to sell. Seeking copies of:

1. [thing=214880][/thing]
2. [thing=251053][/thing] (the original, not the recent iELLO release of NY/London)

Thanks!

A couple of quick notes:

1) If you want to ship your games to Vegas rather than paying for bags, send me a GM. As long as I don&#039;t have a U-Hauls worth of demand, I&#039;m happy to help. I am also trying to think of a way to help people ship games home affordably.

2) A quick way to make sure you haven&#039;t missed any offers or questions about your listings is to use the alpha list (https://yulgame.com/Vfm/Items/308714). Sort by seller and check listings that have a value in the &quot;Bids/Comments&quot; column.
 
3) Cashless options(venmo, PayPal, zelle) may have tax consequences for 2023. I&#039;ve been moving cashless, but this puts a wrinkle in those plans.

BIN is &quot;Buy it Now&quot;. Basically give me this price and it&#039;s yours. 

SB is &quot;Starting Bid&quot;. That is where the seller is asking for the lowest bid on a game start if it is an auction-type sale.

I much prefer they delete so that I don&#039;t get a million subscription updates.

Do you have a good reason people shouldn&#039;t delete?

[q=&quot;Bulkoth&quot;][q=&quot;nyfilmfest&quot;]It would be great if people didn&#039;t delete listings! You can simply edit/comment if something is no longer for sale.[/q]

I much prefer they delete so that I don&#039;t get a million subscription updates.

Do you have a good reason people shouldn&#039;t delete?
[/q]

Unsubscribe?

I keep track of the item #s. I also keep track of the urls, so it&#039;s just a redundancy.

It also leaves a record of the listing in case it needs to be referenced by either party leading up to the event. 

Once an item sells it has very little action anyways. And you can hide any listing you aren&#039;t interested in if you subscribe to the entire thread. Easier to do as the list populates for sure.

Also prevents people from deleting and relisting items just because they didn&#039;t sell, which no one is doing AFAIK, but would be bad form.

None of those are what&#039;s happening, no one is deleting sold items or relisting, they are deleting things no longer for sale.

If you just bid on stuff you&#039;re interested in you can use your own &quot;contributions&quot; page instead of keeping a separate list. 👍

Every listing has a unique URL extension.  I addressed that two dozen posts ago in this comment thread.

Asking several dozen sellers to not delete listings is like trying to herd cats.  Not worth the headache, so just track the unique URL extensions.

Other VFM threads I&#039;ve participated in have it as a rule. It&#039;s not hard to have rules that people follow.

This one doesn&#039;t. Fair enough. I can cope.

What&#039;s the difference between the &quot;hide&quot; feature and the &quot;block&quot; for individual listings? I usually select &quot;block&quot; to not receive updates, but never noticed the &quot;hide&quot; option before.

It will be minimized if you hide it, but will still trigger subscriptions.

Should something be sold in auction format, it’s up to each individual seller.

Just to help those out who are heading to the Virtual Flea Market Exchange. Make yourself a sign before heading out with your name and BGG name. That way you aren&#039;t just waiting to hear your name called amongst the other 50 names being called out. People can meander through the tables and spot you much easier. 

Also. I printed out my QR codes for PayPal and VenMo last year so people could easily get to my account. I don&#039;t like exchanging money until goods are exchanged so it can get pretty overwhelming to constantly help people find your account in the app. 

The distance from the rooms to the conference room is pretty far. Even in the Ipanema tower. So if you are bringing or buying a lot keep that in mind. I&#039;m taking a foldable dolly this year to help with my bags I&#039;m taking.

All EXCELLENT advice Brian. I bought a cart after learning from last year. I also recommend if paying by cash, put each transaction in an envelope and write the details on the outside. Much quicker to hand over instead of trying to make change every time. 

Signs with usernames were very helpful last year.

The non-virtual flea market is on Saturday 10a-1pm. If you want to sell, you need to reserve a table for $20 (at my.cardboardevents website).

Thanks for addressing this, Dian. You are correct. This VFM/MT meet-up is Friday morning. You only want to show up to execute the deals you&#039;ve already made here or in the Math Trade.

On Saturday there will be a huge flea market. Last year, folks started lining up almost 2 hours before the doors opened and there were approx 300 people in line at doors open. We had a small space and had to limit how many could enter. This year, our space is massive and should be able to let everyone it at the same time. If you want to sell, you need to buy a table. If you want to buy, bring something to play while you&#039;re in line, or just swing in after the madness of opening :)

We have 190+ sellers. It&#039;s not realistic to dedicate that amount of space, so the alternative is limiting participation.

Maybe we can kind of self-regulate?  Those near the front of the alphabet try to stay near the front, middle-ish near the middle, and those of us near the end towards the back/far end?

I think this is the best option but we would still have to establish how people are sorting themselves. Username, first name, last name, mother&#039;s maiden name?

I sure hope it&#039;s by BGG username. That&#039;s how I&#039;m marking my envelopes.

[q=&quot;ColtonReese&quot;]Does anyone know the user Blairie?
They placed a winning bid on one of my games but upon trying to message them, it appears the username no longer exists.
I&#039;m debating whether or not to pack their game...[/q]
They have a couple of my items as well and never responded to my geekmail I sent to everyone this week. But honestly not everyone does. They just show up exactly where they are supposed to. Odd though that their username doesn&#039;t exist though. It definitely did a week ago. I fully expect to not complete a transaction or two each year that I do this. It is simply bound to happen. This may be one of them. Nice thing this year is I have a table the following day to try again.

Both are taking place at the same location, which is the large open gaming room, not the one containing vendors.

This is going to Will for $5 IF I find the missing orange ball. 
So this item was discovered to be incomplete after I posted it. Will S doesn&#039;t want it incomplete the way I understand it.

Great! I&#039;ll be coming in Thursday and heading out very early Sunday. I am sure we can manage something during that time with Thursday probably being the easiest. It&#039;s small so it should be easy to get dow to the convention floor. I&#039;ll message you closer to the event to exchange information.

Sounds good. I&#039;ll add Arnak (MvMS4) and Vindication (MVMS4) to your other promos. $8 for the 2 of those total.

Unfortunately no, sorry! The used retail edition is going for $90-$100 on the Geek Market, and this is a new-in-shrink deluxe edition with the expansion, so $70 is already a decent amount lower than I probably should be listing it for.

I didn&#039;t know there were that many versions. This is not the collector&#039;s edition from the recent Kickstarter, if that&#039;s what you&#039;re asking. It&#039;s the standard edition with an aftermarket wood insert and the Secrets expansion.

Just throwing this out there as I mainly only want the game for spare parts and to cannibalize it for fan-made / home-brew content, but if you’re open to $35 for it then I will relieve you of it.  :)

As long as nothing gets damaged, then I do not need the box and that would work fine for me.  I just need everything except the box.  :)

Since Mark hasn’t replied yet and if it’s permitted, I would like to bid higher on this.  I would bid $40 if allowed.

I don’t mean to upset Steven or anyone, but last year some people did just that prior to a confirmed sale.

If it’s not allowed, I will refrain from doing this again.  It’s just I’ve been hunting this down for a while now.

Note that JLKM Games have a hand-made feel to them. The box cover paper is separating from the cardboard of the box in a few areas. This creates a few an &apos;air bubbles&apos; on the box cover. Rated VERY GOOD due to the air bubbles. Otherwise, like new.</body>

excellent. Includes a bunch of player aids printed in color.

...forgot to mention.  When I got this game, the shipping box had been punched.  This made a hole in the bottom of the game box.  I repaired it with clear packing tape.  Hole is not noticeable.</body>

Just a heads up, if you want to have the picture and title show, you can edit this and list an  accessory instead of boardgame (search Catan and this is like the 2nd item or close to that anyway).

Damage to box.  A bottom corner of the box has been crushed a bit.  The box lid had a split seam that was repaired with clear glue and then reinforced with packing tape on the inside of the lid.  The repair looks pretty good.

Components excellent.</body>

No insert in the box. Components have been bagged. The game box sides are a little warped - this has been reported in a BGG forum comment as a known manufacturing issue. This game was manufactured in China. The game boards are NOT warped. Otherwise, excellent.</body>

Sorry, I have no idea how I didn&#039;t see this comment.  It&#039;s TMG, it does say Cwali on the outside of the box, whatever that means.

Actually, looking at the alpha list it doesn&#039;t even show that there is a comment so I guess that explains it :/

For those who are curious, I literally just bought an All-In set just like this and received it this week.  I paid a little less, but this is still in shrink.  Which is to say that the listed price here is competitive.  I can’t wait to play this!  (I’m also local in Vegas).

Thankfully they are all games I already own (except for Brass: Birmingham Deluxe Edition). Last year I said I was going to cull games, and I culled my collection from 208 to 241. This year I&#039;m going to see if I can actually achieve that goal.

[q=&quot;steveusa&quot;]Hi Kevin - This is the deluxe edition, with all the wooden discs and metal first-player etc etc, correct?  If so, I&#039;ll take it at $90 if it&#039;s still available. - Steve[/q]

Yes it is, you got it!

OK, I just went through and did a component check - everything is accounted for and in great shape. There is scuffing on a couple of box corners, so that&#039;s the reason for &quot;good&quot;. Do you still want it?

I won&#039;t be selling it for $30. I bought it to eventually play it but if I can sell it for the price I paid then I can just acquire it again down the road when my shelf of shame gets played.

English edition and includes [thing=301357]Alchemists[/thing], as well as some cute storage boxes and hard plastic card cases. Like new, played twice.

$50 or best offer.  (I like drafting and particularly dice drafting, though in this game you try to [i]avoid[/i] drafting new dice as much as possible. Wasn&apos;t what I expected, though otherwise a solid game.)</body>

No, I wouldn&#039;t have any confidence in it getting through air travel without getting damaged (it&#039;s nothing but a small stack of cards).  It&#039;s at least safe in the box.

Each set of 33 bases is color matched to the advancement track they belong to, yellow for the tech card bases, silver for space tiles, copper for Tapestry cards, and dark blue for Landmark Cards. Each base has the name of the building visible on the base.

Since I designed these, I have multiple sets.

Hey Blake, let&#039;s trade for IKI!

Also I don&#039;t know if you saw my [geeklist=308955]best new to me in 2022 geek list[/geeklist] but I thought you should know that [listitem=9441787]Mangrovia made the top ten![/listitem] 🙂

Any chance we get some gaming in together this year at the con?

If you don&#039;t get this sold I&#039;d offer to take the 3D terrain off your hands.

Just want to check that this includes all of the Kickstarter Deluxe exclusives and such. I understand that post-KS Deluxe editions are missing the KS exclusives.

If so, I&#039;ll bid $100.

@andre_c I am confirming that you haver responded with $55 offer and intent to purchsae NAMIKI, and that I&#039;ll bring it to DTW next week to make the transaction.

I sent you a DM - please confirm ASAP, as packing all the games in a carryon will be challenging so I would h8 to bring games to Vegas only to not make the sale. Thank you.

On top, corners are visibly creased and very slightly dented in as if someone carried the heavy box with one hand. On bottom, one corner shows bit more of similar damage to box only.</body>

Very Good to Like New

[i]Includes all of the following:[/i]
   - The Others (with Go7 Gaming insert) [url=https://go7gaming.com/product/others-001-for-the-others/]Go7 Gaming Insert: Base Game[/url]
   - Apocalypse Expansion with Apocalypse Extras (one figure painted)
   - Beta Team Expansion (with Go7 Gaming insert) [url=https://go7gaming.com/product/othtm-001-for-the-others-teams/]Go7 Gaming Insert: Teams[/url]
   - Omega Team Expansion
   - Gamma Team Expansion
   - Men of Faith Expansion (with Go7 Gaming insert) [url=https://go7gaming.com/product/othsml-001-for-the-others-small-box/]Go7 Gaming Insert: Small Box[/url]
   - Sons of Ragnarok Expansion
   - Envy Expansion
   - Greed Expansion
   - Lust Expansion
   - Wrath Expansion
   - Gluttony Expansion
   - Corruption Pack / Wounds Pack
   - Dice Packs (multiple - I would guess at least 5-6)
   - Also comes with doubles of many components from base game, including a large number of minis

Basically, the only thing missing is Delta Team Expansion. I currently have everything stored with the Go7 Gaming inserts and one extra core box. But I have all the boxes as well I could bring. Main box is in good condition with some shelf wear. The extra base box is taped up in some parts. Other boxes in great condition aside from one Sin that has a damaged edge. [/-]

Everything was opened, only played once though.

This was for the all-in pledge from the kickstarter.  I have everything except the artbook.  So all gameplay expansions bit upgrades and the playmat.  Again I&apos;ll look through kickstarter and post a detailed breakdown later.

	<body>Kickstarter Legend Pledge.  Opened, played a few times, very good to new condition.

Ah, a living legend! By backing at this pledge level, your rewards include everything from the Hero pledge plus the exclusive Lost Levels gameplay expansion.

That means the Legend Pledge includes:
♫ Bardsung Core Box 
♫ Exclusive Lost Levels Expansion 
♫ Exclusive Gladestrider Hero 
♫ Exclusive Oni Wandering Monster 
♫ All Unlocked Quest Goals 
♫ All Daily Unlocks

Because there’s already so much to experience in the core game—over 70 hours, and with our guest writers adding new adventures on top—the Lost Levels is Bardsung’s only gameplay expansion in this campaign.

So, we’ve created the Legend pledge to keep things simple. It includes a colossal discount of $91 (£73) on the MSRP equivalent. And the elf-eyed among you will notice it also comes with an on-Kickstarter discount of $5.

If gameplay is your focus, the Legend pledge level is for you.

The game is complete and great shape. The box top has only minor wear. The box bottom has a one inch puncture/tear from another box corner and a small area where tape has peeled of some of the image (white blotch) See pics. [imageid=7300549][imageid=7300554][imageid=7300562]

	<body>I got this second hand, but it doesn&apos;t appear to have been played. The stickers for the tokens are still on the sticker sheet. All bits/tiles are accounted for. 

The only question is, it is unclear how many tile trays the game should have. There is one in the box, which I think is correct, but many people online have multiple trays for easier organization.

Hey Ted,  this is the most important thing for me as it’s the main thing I’m really looking for:

“Also, resource cubes, players cubes and city/greenery tiles were not counted but are substantially complete.“

So my offer would be contingent on those items.

I would offer $20 for this listing if that’s agreeable.

That&#039;s an absolutely fair offer, but the wife won&#039;t go for it since we already have Martian Rails; the most I can do is 30. Again, I understand if you can&#039;t. If you want to wait for other offers and let me know on the last day if you haven&#039;t sold and are willing to part for that amount, that&#039;d be fine, as well. No rush.

The components are complete and in very good condition. Some of the wheelbarrow tiles are a tight fit, which was a known production issue, but nothing that will keep you from enjoying the game.

	<body>The edition pictured, works perfectly. one or 2 of the cardboard &quot;credit cards&quot; have a wrinkle. Missing a small cardboard overlay that does on the staircase, and the rules are a printout from a similar edition. None of this inhibits gameplay, which I suggest only to conjure up memories from the 90&apos;s:D

It’s considered part of the insert.  Do you not want the insert?  Just the towers?

Yes, I&#039;m just interested in the towers &amp; since it appears (I could be wrong) that they won&#039;t fit inside the box anyway, I thought you may consider selling them seperately.

They do fit.  The insert itself is just short enough for everything to fit into the box.  It’s a pretty cool design.  I’d like to keep them together.

All yours Leo. Hope you have room in the suitcase. I&#039;ll be at the Friday exchange. Plan to reach out to you closer to the event to exchange information. Happy to exchange locally if you are southern California.

Is this the extreme ks edition with the metal coins and extras? If so, I&#039;ll BIN for $30. Otherwise, nevermind. I already own the standard retail version.

Update: apparently the Deluxe edition is from the first ks and X-treme is from the second. Both have various extras (such as metal coins). If be willing to bin for either, as long as it&#039;s not the standard edition.

@kimberly and @nathan if y’all are willing to work out a price where I can split it I’d be happy to. 

I priced expansions at 25 since sealed and the base would be 20 since opened. (If bought separately)

@nathan if you would do 20 for base I can then sell Kimberly the expansions at 20. Then it’s like I’m selling the lot for my bin price! 

No worries if neither side is happy. Im ok holding on for someone to buy the lot!

I forgot to check back here... I think my 5 y/o will love this game, and I&#039;m going to get it regardless. Excited to get the game and both expansions, but might just pull the trigger on the base game if I don&#039;t hear back

I’ll have to close it tonight once I’m home (lots of listings to update!) I’ll prolly take the latest bid I see that is still March 1st. I start packing tomorrow morning which is the point of closing the auction. 

if you want an exact time I’d say march 1st 11:59pm pst to be fair to everyone.

This item was not set up as auction. The “best offer” part is there if you want to make a bundle/trade/other type of offer but cash is the bin price. Sorry if that was not clear. 

I’ll keep your offer in mind so thanks for placing it but my response would be no thanks right now.

Thought the best offer part was tallying up and whoever has the highest best offer would end up with it. Sorry for my confusion. In that case would ya bundle the 2 picture perfects for $16?

Game comes from a smoke free home. I will be in Vegas from Mon 3/6 evening to Sun 3/12 morning, though leaving early on Sunday. Prefer to handle any sale outside of the prescribed VFM time itself (and even more preferably on Tuesday through Thursday). COD, PayPal, or Venmo are all okay! Happy to consider all reasonable offers. </body>

Game comes from a smoke free home. I will be in Vegas from Mon 3/6 evening to Sun 3/12 morning, though leaving early on Sunday. Prefer to handle any sale outside of the prescribed VFM time itself (and even more preferably on Tuesday PM through Thursday PM). COD, PayPal, or Venmo are all okay! Happy to consider all reasonable offers.

They have that listed as the BIN (buy it now) price, so it should be over.  Nothing wrong with what you did.

There are absolutely no hard feelings at all. That&#039;s the purpose of Buy It Now. I&#039;m cheap and wanted to save a few bucks and deserve to get punished every so often 😅
Also thanks for saving me the room in my suitcase!

I tried contacting Grail Games to replace the piece but they never responded to me.  However, I glued the two pieces together so it&apos;s perfectly functional and you can barely tell that it was glued. 

Selling for $35.

I will be in Vegas Thursday night through Sunday morning. I will be at the meet up on Friday morning, but can also arrange for a pick up during other times. Also, this is available for local pick-up in Orange County, CA prior to the con weekend.[/-]

Correct. This listing includes the upgrade pack which is much better than $126 on eagle Griff site.

Better to just DM the person if you want to discuss pricing for the item. That&#039;d be a more respectful way to handle it than having hundreds-thousands of users observe your inaccurate comment.

Hi! I&#039;m coming in Thrusday early evening and staying until Sunday. I&#039;ll be gone super early Sunday morning though. Plan to be at the Friday exchange to unload everything. I&#039;ll message you closer to the event to exchange information and you can let me know if we need to make other arrangements around the exchange.

No, but thanks for asking. I do like Tuscany so if it doesn&#039;t sell I&#039;d rather either keep it all. Plus I just don&#039;t have the desire to separate out all the bits at this point :)

[b]Update:[/b]  Someone requested pictures of my sweet insert mod.  I cut the channel out of the center &quot;wall&quot; to give the player boards a place to sit flat.  And no, they didn&apos;t fit sideways in the bottom half - at least not cleanly.  Plus, this is just the right depth to then allow the central board to sit flat on top of all this.  I also used a punchboard section to try to keep the little tiles in place when stored.

Game was missing one of the barrel goods tiles, but I made a replacement which I think is a pretty good replica.  Otherwise components are complete.

Yep! VFM = Virtual Flea Market, sorry for the confusion! Friday morning at 10:00am is the meetup, where the majority of everybody who&#039;re making transactions will meet up in a room (i don&#039;t think we know exactly where yet), and do all their buying and selling. I&#039;m already there so that&#039;s the easier place for me to hand it off! Feel free to GM me to coordinate further!

Alternatively, if you wanted to do $25 together for this and Raiders of Scythia, I could close them both now. I don&#039;t know if you feel like that buys you anything

Thanks for the offer, but I&#039;ll go ahead and wait it out. Still a little on the fence on both, but if I get them for what I offered then I&#039;ll be happy to try them out. Thanks again.

Thanks, I&#039;m getting Overboss at DTW as well and thought I should give the game the world is based on a whirl too.

	<body>Selling almost everything for Red Dragon Inn. Every expansion that has come out. Every single card is sleeved. Missing some of the special drinks just because I didn&apos;t want to pay that much extra on the kickstarters. Each character that has been released is there. The boxes are very large and take up too much space for me and I don&apos;t play the game often enough anymore. The cards are split between the character trove and the smorgasbox. Asking 250</body>

	<body>***THIS IS NOT FOR THE GAME ITSELF***

I have an extra set of deluxe wooden tokens and metal coins for Mosaic.  If you&apos;re curious what they look like, check out the Kickstarter page, as this is a complete set of the deluxe bits that were available via the Kickstarter as an add on (they came included with the game if you got the Colossus Edition, and available as an add-on set if you ordered an edition other than Colossus).  

The set comes with:

- Two types of wooden food tokens (1-wood and 5-wood denominations) 
- Two types of wooden stone tokens (1-stone and 5-stone denominations)
- Two types of wooden ideas tokens (1-idea and 5-ideas denominations)
- Set of metal coins in 1-, 5- and 10-coin denominations

These were never used and remain sealed and shrink wrapped.

Not sure what the going rate would be for these, so I&apos;ll start the bidding at $10 and sell to the highest bidder.

Once the bidding gets going, I&apos;ll plan to close the auction once there&apos;s been no action for a few days

	<body>[b]$90[/b] - please read details below

This is a huge bundle stored in the Heat Wave box.  I&apos;m pretty sure this is the $130 Commissioner pledge level from the Career KS campaign ([url]https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/vanrydergames/hostage-negotiator-career?ref=nav_search&amp;result=project&amp;term=hostage%20negotiator[/url]).

Note that it appears to include all 10 abductor packs [b]except #8[/b] - for some reason there are 2 cards from 8 but none of the rest.  I&apos;m not sure if it was removed for some reason, or this was actually the $100 level (this included 9 and 10, plus any 7 others) with some extras (like the meeples) included as add-ons. 

It includes the base game, Career, Heat Wave, both sets of screen printed meeples, and various extras -- all in great shape.  To be honest, I&apos;m not super familiar with this game so doing a full inventory of an all-in KS version is tricky.  I did check all of the cards in the dividers and it seems like everything from the KS is there (except pack #8, mentioned above).  There are extra dividers with other stuff, but I don&apos;t think those came with the KS.  The Career stuff is still in it&apos;s box and everything inside is unopened.  Most of the cards are sleeved and it looks like it was maybe played once or twice (a few of the packs were out of order in the dividers).  The enveloped items are unopened.

Full bundle seems to sell for $150-200.  Since #8 is missing and I&apos;m not 100% sure on some of this, I&apos;ll offer this for [b]$90[/b].

I will be at the Fri 10am meetup, but will also be at the con all 5 days if you need to arrange another time.

Thanks for the alert. I sent him the offer a few days ago. I don&#039;t think he is interested at my price.

Hmm, now that I actually look into the theme of the game I’m interested and will take it for $50

Kyoto was a highlight of our trip to Japan and this seems like a cool way to remember some of the sights :)

Thanks guys - ya I was on the fence b/c right after I posted that comment below as part of  my wishlist, I saw they announced an expansion to [thing=347013][/thing] (called [thing=380105][/thing]) and so at the price offered, I thought I might want to wait and see a bit more about the expansion before deciding to go for the original Let&#039;s Make a Bus Route or jumping into the newer version w/ expansion.  Thanks, though, for trying to connect the dots, Stewart!  I hope you enjoy it!   It does look quite fun, and there&#039;s a good chance I seek it out again if the expansion doesn&#039;t intrigue me.

	<body>Western Legends: Prospecting Deck 
$15

Brand New. Includes the Dark Knight character promo cards.

Prospecting for gold, FIXED! The 16 card Western Legends: Prospecting Deck balances the distribution of gold available to be mined. It also introduces a variety of new events to spice up gameplay! Includes 5 legendary Dark Knight promo cards! 

The Prospecting Deck can fit in the Mountain Range, which I also have for sale.

I&apos;ll be at DTW Friday - Sunday.

Please [b]message me[/b] if you want a Prospecting Deck. 🙂

Technically, this game is the collector&apos;s edition, but it&apos;s in pretty awful condition. All the collectible movers are there. I have no idea what to do with this, so feel free to shoot me an offer. [/-]

Are we talking the box is in awful condition? Or the pieces as well? Wondering how the money/property/chance/community chest cards are looking. Cheers!

Hi Ben! I mean, I hate to say this, but nothing is in great condition. Most of the money is good (though slightly warped) and the majority of the cards are looking pretty worn. I had this and played it when I was much younger and didn&#039;t really care about keeping it nice 😅.

Unless you&#039;re really interested (or want some of the other movers maybe), I think I&#039;ll go ahead and sell the pieces to Ginger to complete her son&#039;s set :)

Ginger, fun to know your son has the set. Is he into Pokémon?

I can totally do just the pieces. If I&#039;m going to bring those, do you want me to bring the rest of the movers (backups?), or anything else? Just let me know

Thank you! Yes, he has always loved Pokemon 🙂 If you want to bring the extra pieces I will put them aside for spares but if not that&#039;s okay too. Thanks so much!

	<body>A few years ago there was a game subscription service called Battle Bin. They sent out Loot crates with various small games, promos and accessories. 

One of those items was an early demo set for Rum and Bones. It included 2 captains, a handful of pirates a small deck of cards, various tokens (including acrylic damage tokens) and card stock skirmish board. I think all of it was part of the first version of the retail game. A great way to get your feet wet or to fill out your pirate armies, or practice painting. See pics for what is included. Everything is new and unplayed. The board has some minor wear (it actually didn&apos;t fit the battle bin box very well.)

(The box is about 6&quot;x6&quot; so the board is separate flat piece.)

[-]$20[/-] $15

I can&apos;t make the scheduled Friday morning meet up but I am onsite Tuesday night to M
Sunday. Happy to arrange an alternative meet up.

Components are like new, but one corner of the box cover is taped, which is how it arrived when I bought it used. Otherwise, it&apos;s in perfect condition. EDIT: Does not include the Dead of Winter characters because the previous owner appears to have kept them. 

SB $10

Sorry to ask another question. I assume this isnt the headmaster pledge but the base + expansions separately? (aka no second set of library components or the bigger box?)

Hey Brian, I don&#039;t mean to offend, but I&#039;ll toss $50 out as an offer on this. I completely understand if that doesn&#039;t work, but figured it couldn&#039;t hurt to make the offer. Cheers.

Takes a lot more than that to offend me! But no, I wont sell it that low. I was just trying to get rid of it quick but I can throw it up on ebay and make $100+ no problem so I will do that if it doesn&#039;t sell. Thanks though!

	<body>Crochet &quot;Bird Nest&quot; Bowls

My daughter loves to crochet and made me some little bowls to use as nests for Wingspan.  I loved them so much I suggested making a few more to sell.  She also made a few little draw bags and has one left.

Note that in the images below, the Wingspan eggs used are what&apos;s included in the base game, so 1 large bowl or 2 smalls work great (maybe more if you have expansions or extras).  Of course, you can certainly use them for other stuff as well.  The Crew is shown to give approximate scale.

These are lovely.  I don&#039;t play Wingspan very often so I&#039;m not going to grab some right away so that Wingspaners get a chance, but I might come back if they&#039;re not snatched up!

I actually have a set of two other small ones that are basically the same but a slightly different yarn. I didn&#039;t include them in the post to keep it simple, but I can bring them along. If you like them, they&#039;re yours :)

I love Dwellings of Eldervale! During my first game, I couldn’t read the dungeon tray cards on the other end of the table. Making it very hard to strategize. Sooo...
I designed these Dungeon Tray Stands. They save table space, and make it easier for all players to read the cards! I also like using the lid of the box to raise one stand higher. It’s functional and looks awesome! Plus they fit in the box!

I&apos;ll be at DTW Friday-Sunday

Note: Printed filament color is black.

$85 if it is pet/smoke free. How many times has it been played?

It&#039;s smoke free. I do own a dog but she doesn&#039;t interact with the board games at all. I&#039;m not sure what the expectation is. I am very meticulous about cleaning my table before playing games.
It&#039;s been played twice.

	<body>[-]Collector&apos;s Edition includes 30 metal point tokens, 6 wooden rat workers, 20 wooden Occupied tokens with stickers, deluxe 8-sided die, Legendary expansion, Extra! Extra! cards, and Rugwort!  
Slip cover has VERY minor damage (looks worse in attached pics than it really is, as these are extreme closeups).  Some scuffing on slipcover, box itself is pristine.

Starting bid:  [b][size=18]$75[/size][/b]
Closing bids sometime on March 1st.

I will be at the con all 5 days, arriving Tues evening.

[imageid=7359699][imageid=7359700][/-]

The damage on the slipcover truly is very tiny.  But I guess that is still too much.  Anyhow, I own this game and have played it, but it just didn&apos;t do anything for me.  I&apos;d rather see someone who really enjoys the game to own it instead.  Those metal point tokens are pretty sweet.  And the expansion stuff seems pretty cool.  I just think there are others out there who would enjoy it a lot more.  Others are selling this for $85-99 on eBay and Amazon, so I thought my price was fair.  If you want it, email me an offer before noon March 5.  Not sure if I&apos;ll be bringing this with me or not, otherwise.</body>

I&#039;ve played a few times and enjoy it.  I actually played the Ozaku version way back during my first BGG.con shortly after it released and always thought it would be cool to track down this edition for sentimental reasons.  Very happy to see it here :)

	<body>[-]English-only deluxe second edition (2021)
Publisher: Tasty Minstrel Games

[-]Brand new, in-shrink. No visible flaws.[/-]
Opened but unpunched, like new, perfect condition. (I opened it just to verify that there is no mold.)

This is the Kickstarter Deluxified edition. TMG is out of business. Who know if or when the game will be reprinted, let alone the deluxe edition.

Photos showing the cover and inside the box, showing no signs of mold:
[imageid=7363921 inline] [imageid=7363922 inline] [imageid=7363923 inline]

[-]$110[/-] $100.00, lower offers considered.

I will be at the con Thursday-Sunday and at the VFM meetup.

Withdrawn, sold elsewhere.</body>

I think some of these might be worth a few bucks, but I just want to see them go to a good home, so I&apos;ll offer them here for free.  Please feel free to claim any you actually plan to use - if they do have value, please don&apos;t take them to resell.

Did you want both packs or just one?  There&#039;s two duplicate packs, each with the same 5 or 6 cards.

If all of the cards are intact and undamaged, I can do the BIN $15. I&#039;ll be at the con from Tuesday night to Sunday morning, so we can work out a meetup time.

Cool, like I said, I&#039;ll be there from Tuesday night (hoping to make it to the casino around 6, have dinner, and then check in since I think they&#039;re doing an early checkin the night before), through Sunday morning (leaving around 8 or 9 Sunday morning). So either we can meet at the Flea Market or if an earlier time works for you, just let me know when. I&#039;m in a game of Anno 1800 Wednesday from 1-4pm, so I should be in one location for at least 2 hours, which might be an easy time to have us make the trade. I have another person meeting me up at that time and I can let you know the location once I know it.

Venus was released as a stand alone base game set (that&#039;s what this is) AND as a expansion only, this has slightly different maps than the regular Concordia game with some overlap and some not.

$42 - Concordia Venus+

I suppose at this point I should ask…is the New Beginnings expansion box included, or are the expansion components simply incorporated into the base box?

Thanks Ven.  What was your limit?  Can I go a dollar over that instead. LOL  I got rid of my original copy years ago for some reason I can&#039;t remember now but really like this game and looking forward to playing it again.    Let me know if you want to try and get a game in at the Con.

I decided not to go above $70 — I think I have a decent shot at finding another set around that price if I keep an eye out.

I’d love to play if you’re up for it!  I’ll send you a PM.

I don’t  believe this is an auction. FP is fixed price.

[q=&quot;burybryce&quot;]I tried ;) … some do them as auctions[/q]

You&#039;re totally right. Since I&#039;ve seen you make this accidental oops a few times, I thought I&#039;d share the easy way to tell:

* [b]Auctions[/b] literally always say auctions or &quot;bid&quot; on them. They tend to be less common and the seller is always super clear in stating that they are an auction. 

* [b]Non-Auction[/b]. Typically these just have a price. Sometimes they say FP (fixed price) or BIN (buy it now). The key thing is that they don&#039;t mention the word auction or bid.

Hope that helps and have a great DTW!

How about $7? Since I&#039;ll have to tote it to Vegas from California. 😜

It really is a nicer version than the one they sell at Target.

Sorry for the delay in getting back. I&#039;ve had issues pop up preventing this trip, but seems resolved for now. I&#039;m assuming you&#039;re packed already so that&#039;s ok. I&#039;ll take the counter offer as a sign I&#039;ve bought too much as it is. We&#039;ll meet up for the other 2 games anyway. Thanks for considering and making my kids happy.

This is the much prettier Japanese edition (2018), as pictured. Great I-split-you-choose filler game. Nice small box fits everything perfectly. No wasted space. Rules are in Japanese, but the game is language independent to play, and English rules are easily found on BGG. Components in very good condition. Box is very good except for a few minor dings.

Mr. [user=Bentadams1][/user] has informed me that the app for this game has been removed for the App Store, and is likely unplayable for anyone “new” to this game. If you have the app, apparently you can still play it? In addition, you can still use the expansion cards if you already have the game…so I won’t take down the listing and would entertain offers on any part.

I’m not sure about the whole scenario but I appreciate Ben letting me (us) know that and don’t want to mislead anyone. :)

Ben’s information is accurate. We got the game and app just before it came down from the App Store.

My Wife is a music teacher and she runs a music studio from our home. We have a copy of the base game and might be interested in the expansion cards. If you want to off load the whole thing I can take it off your hands but my main interest would be the cards. I hope it goes without saying, but I don’t relish the idea of spending $25 for the lot. I would potentially offer $10 for the card. Let me know what you think.

Hey Alan. Glad to let the whole thing go for $10. You’d be doing me a favor by helping me relinquish some shelf space. Let me know if you’re still interested. 🙂

	<body>Brand new and sealed. German, as pictured, but language independent to play. This is a cute roll-and-write in minimal paper packaging, marketed as sustainable with the rules acting as the package for the sheets. (English rules readily available online.) Comes with two different configurations to play, so a different format on each side of the sheet.

This is the MUCH more attractive original Japanese/English edition, as pictured. From what I understand, they aren&apos;t going to print any more of this version, now that the -- in my opinion -- less attractive Oink version is on the market.

AMAZING trick-taker. Can&apos;t recommend it enough. This copy is open, but in very good condition. A few cards have a tiny bit of ink smearing, which is common with this edition, but does not affect gameplay or card readability. Comes with both English and Japanese rules. Language independent to play. Small, minor stain on box top, as seen in the photo above. Overall, a much nicer looking and functional deck compared to the new Oink version.

Would you take $60? There have been a couple other copies on here that went for that. :)

	<body>This is NOT for the game.

I have 2 [b]Dwellings of Eldervale Upgrade Packs[/b] available. 

1- [b]Castle and Shard Modules[/b] - $20 - Includes 6 castles and 24 shards.
Add even more variety to your Dwellings adventures. The Castles and Shards are Official modules designed by Luke Laurie and can be found on BGG.   

2- [b]Dungeon Tray Stands[/b] - $15 - Includes 2 stands. 
I love Dwellings of Eldervale! During my first game, I couldn’t read the dungeon tray cards on the other end of the table. Making it very hard to strategize. Sooo...
I designed these Dungeon Tray Stands. They save table space, and make it easier for all players to read the cards! I also like using the lid of the box to raise one stand higher. It’s functional and looks awesome! Plus they fit in the box! Note: Printed filament color is black. 

I&apos;ll be at DTW Friday-Sunday
Please message me if you&apos;d like either upgrade pack!

Wow. I&#039;ve been wanting to try this game out for a while and your minis look fantastic.

I&#039;d like to buy this one for the asking price of $100. Thanks!

	<body>This is for an Unlock Bundle.
The games have been played but in good to great condition.  For games in which a card needed to be folded.  It was but the condition is still playable (think of it as having a clue for the puzzle).  The games have been reset.

Includes:
-Star Wars Unlock! - $25
-Unlock Heroic Adventures - $15
-Unlock Mythic adventures - $15
-Unlock:  The Nautilis&apos; Traps
-Unlock:  Expedition:  challenger
-Unlock:  the House on the HIll
-Unlock:  Scheherazade&apos;s Last Tale
-Unlock:  The Formula

$70.  Willing to take lower offers or trade.  Can also separate piecemeal if only some of them are desired.  $5 for each one other than if listed with a different price.

I know it&#039;s low, but if you really want to get rid of this I&#039;ll throw out an offer of $35.  It&#039;s high on my list to try, but I&#039;ve already bought too much other junk :)

SB means starting bid. BIN means Buy it Now. 

Bidding ends tonight. I am selling the retail edition but nothing within the Kickstarter if that is what you are asking. It is because I have the Kickstarter that i am selling the retail edition. It is a good game and I got the retail edition as reward for helping publisher but had already backed KS.

Cool - that is what I was thinking but wasn&#039;t entirely sure. I will do/start $40.  So to clarify you wouldn&#039;t part with the solo components from the Sphinx for a bit extra?  I really want to get the game but really bumped about the solo not being included with the retail version.  Of course if you think you would use it I completely understand but sometime people don&#039;t touch the solo modes of their games.

Correct, At this time i don&#039;t think i want to separate the solo portion form the KS.

	<body>If you had Trapper Keepers in school when you were a kid, then you’ll feel an instant connection to the game packaging and components. As for gameplay, it’s fun collecting cards, making sets, and reading all of the humorous notes, homework assignments, and reasons for detention. Has the same weight and feel as Sushi Go! and Cat Lady. Very good condition.

Out of print. Fun set collection game with cute artwork, especially for coffee and tea lovers. Small palm size box for travel, so this is a perfect cafe game. Does not include the useless, gimmicky plastic coffee cup that takes up most of the original retail packaging. Very good condition for the cards and card box.

Out of print Nina Chanel Abney version (2020), as pictured, in the UNO Artiste series (#3).

This special edition deck features original artwork created by Abney specifically for the Artiste Series. The Chicago-born contemporary artist is known for her vivid paintings that broach subjects as diverse as religion, politics, sex, and celebrity, while brilliantly illustrating them in a way that produces sensory overload. Abney’s bold graphic aesthetic nods to a pop-cubist style, often incorporating elements of abstraction and bracing use of color.

Box open, but cards are new in shrink. Box in sturdy condition except for discoloration in a few places, as pictured below.

Stylish game and box art. Lots of interesting decisions to make as you progress your settlers from Earth to Mars to Ganymede. Gameplay is definitely focused on engine building and set collection, if those are mechanics that you enjoy.

Comes with the base game (very good condition) and the [thing=266181][/thing] expansion (like new - open, but unplayed).
